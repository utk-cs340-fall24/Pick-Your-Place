## What you did not do

I did not fix the us.html, someone else did.

## What problems you encountered

- The US html would not work. I looked into it and tried many different things but did not have enough knowlege on a specific aspect of the code to know what to change to fix it.

## What you accomplished

For this sprint I was able to fix the funciton of the accordian for the Argentina page. I change the title names to the country names so that the  tabs now showed the country name instead of "document".
