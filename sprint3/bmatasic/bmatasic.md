### What problems you encountered

- Found out I needed to register another email for Google.
- Had to create an additional identity for the new email registration.
- Needed to register one of the emails as a verified sender in AWS.
- Faced challenges connecting both emails to the PHP script.
- Experienced troubleshooting issues while testing with templates due to the account being - stuck in the AWS sandbox.
- Realized that the only way to get out of the sandbox was to purchase a domain, which I wanted to avoid.
- Figured out how to integrate the button into our platform.
- Encountered issues sending PHP through localhost, requiring the use of a PHP server to connect and test the email functionality.
- Ran into an issue where the modal didn't display on mobile when clicked, necessitating a fix for the triggering functionality.
