- Pick-Your-Place

## What you planned to do
- Issue 47: planned to add the country name at the top of each country's page (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/47)
- Issue 54: populated US off canvas with real information about the cities (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/54)
- Issue 58: fixed checkbox functionality to where the checkbox unchecks after the city is removed from the bucket list (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/58)
- Issue 75: improved checkbox functionality to where it persists over the different country pages (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/75)

## What you did not do
- Since I commited a lot of code last sprint, my tasks were a little bit more laid back this sprint. Overall, I did not commit as many lines of code, but there was a decent amount of research that went into populating the US cities off canvas. The other issues also took a little bit longer than anticipated to implement.

## What problems you encountered
- Had a hard time figuring out the checkbox functionality. It took me some time to understand where it needed to be implemented and make sure the results were consistent. 
- At first, the pictures were not updating for us off canvas. That was fixed through a group effort by just incorporating that into the data.js file.

## What you accomplished
Throughout out this sprint, I added the country name as a title to each country's page. I made sure that the checkbox functionality works entirely such that the checkbox would uncheck if a city is removed from the bucket list, and the checkbox would persist throughout different pages. I also populated the us cities off canvases with real information.
