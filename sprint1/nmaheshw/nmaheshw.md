Pick-Your-Place

### What you planned to do
- Design a header that will eventually be present at the top of each page in the application [#7] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/7) 
- Add the list of cities to the Bucket List [#12] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/12)
-  Design introduction page [#13] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/13)

### What you did not do
- I completed all the issues that were open for me.

### What problems you encountered
- A major problem I faced was adjusting to the Bootstrap framework when it came to styling. In order to override the
  built-in bootstrap styling code, I needed to include the keyword !important in much of my CSS code.

### What you accomplished
(Give a description of the features you added or tasks you accomplished. Provide some detail here. This section will be a little longer than the bulleted lists above) 
For header bar, I used the bootstrap navbar component to add a title to the page. I used CSS styling and imported a Google Font to make it look cleaner 
and follow a brown color theme, while giving the bucket icon a polished transformation upon hover to promote more interactivity in the UI. In addition to that, I 
made the offcanvas that holds the list of destinations in the user's bucket list slightly more interactive and visually pleasing by adding hover behavior. 
I also added a placeholder 'remove' button to every list item. In future sprints, we will work on adding functionality 
to this button. On the more artistic side, I digitally designed a new background for our software applications starter page. Thankfully, it turned out very cute!
