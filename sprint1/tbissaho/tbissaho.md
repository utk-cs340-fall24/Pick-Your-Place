# What you planned to do

- Connect image overlay onto cards[#15](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/15)
- Add image carousel onto the off canvas for cities[#9](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/9)

## What you did not do

(Give a short bulleted list of the items that you planned to do, but did not accomplish)
I did all the task I planned to do

## What problems you encountered

- Image carousel function is off as it looks as though an image is being skipped over
- The search bar when cleared does not populate the cards back up
- The images on the cards would resize the card box

## What you accomplished

For each card, I add the image overlay that way the cards showed an image of the country. I also added a grid for the cards and gave each card a checkbox that will be used in the future to append to the bucketlist. For the search bar, I created it to remove cards that do not match the input being typed in the search bar and this included city and country names. Lastly, I added the image carousel to a cities off canvas to display different images around the city that users can scroll through or it will slide on its own.
