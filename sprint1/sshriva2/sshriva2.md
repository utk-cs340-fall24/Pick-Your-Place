## What you did not do
- I was suppose to create a robust design just for better quality of the user interface of the globe along with one of my teammates, but that was not able to be completed as planned. We have a design as of now, but we plan to keep working on it throughout.

## What problems you encountered
- Had a hard time implementing the dropdown button, was not able to center it on the page as needed
- The background image took a long time to be adjusted as per what we wanted

## What you accomplished
Throughout this sprint, I was able to create the first and second page that the user would be seeing. Within the first page, we were able to implement a design that serves as the background image. The button on this page directs users to the second page where they can pick their countries. In the second page, I was able to implement a dropdown button. Within those dropdown buttons, each country is linked to its respective html page.
