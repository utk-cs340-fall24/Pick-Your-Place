### What you planned to do
-  City Card Research [#99] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/99)
-  Create README.md [#52] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/88)
-  Make javascript file with object that uses Ajax [#65] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/65)
-  Add consistent naming around the application [#91] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/91)
-  Powerpoint [#96] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/96)

### What you did not do
-  I worked on and finished all of my issues during this sprint except for the powerpoint. That remains in progress and we plan to work on 
   together as a group in the week leading up to the presentation.

### What problems you encountered
- The biggest problem I encountered was designing and debugging the 
  javascript function responsible for fetching the bucket list
  data and emailing it to the user. I had to work with dev tools that
  are accessible through the Inspect functionality of a website.

### What you accomplished
(Give a description of the features you added or tasks you accomplished. Provide some detail here. This section will be a little longer than the bulleted lists above) 

I spent most of this sprint working out the functionality to email the bucket 
list information to the user. This involved a lot of troubleshooting with javascript
and php calls. I worked it out by having print statements be triggered by the 'export'
button in the bucket list offcanvas and looking for that output in the console of the
webpage under dev tools. I also worked with a dummy email to make sure all of the data 
was actually being fetched.
