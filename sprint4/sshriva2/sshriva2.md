- Pick-Your-Place

## What you planned to do

- Issue 99: planned to research several other cities for the city offcanvases (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/99)
- Issue 96: planned to begin working on the powerpoint presentation (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/96)
- also fixed the checkbox functionality, to where it checked and unchecked based on the bucket list


## What you did not do
- We all planned to start working on the powerpoint this week. However, we didn't end up getting to that and realized that it would be better for the powerpoint to be completed in the very end. Once all updates have been made, we wouldn't have to keep changing what's in the powerpoint.

## What problems you encountered
- Had a slighltly hard time getting the city added and city removed alerts to work correctly but was able to figure it out after debugging
