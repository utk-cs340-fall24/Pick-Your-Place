# Sprint 4

Name: Bella Matasic
GitHub ID: bellamatasic
Group Name: Pick Your Place

## What you planned to do

- Make javascript file with object that uses Ajax [#65](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/65)
- Powerpoint [#96](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/96)
- Fix modal around the email button [#89](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/89)
- Video for index.html [#98](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/98)

## What you did not do

- We all intended to begin working on the presentation this week. However, we did not get to that stage and concluded that it would be better if the powerpoint was completed at the conclusion. We wouldn't have to change what's in the ppt after all of the adjustments were made.

## What problems you encountered

- Refactoring code to simplify main page and internal link for countries
- Teaching logic of backend to another developer for handling bucket list data

## Issues you worked on

- Fix modal around the email button [#89](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/89)
- Video for index.html [#98](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/98)
- Make javascript file with object that uses Ajax [#65](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/65)
