## What Program Does
This program adds the offcanvas functionality to a city card. It allows the user to click on the city's card and see all of the city's information.

## How to Run
- Install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey.
- Right click on `index.html` and click `Open with Live Server`

## How It'll Be Used
- We want to place each city's information on an offcanvas similar to this with more features. We would add the addition functionality to the `Add City to Bucket List` button. We would also nest an accordion in the header ones for each of the places the user can add to their list.
