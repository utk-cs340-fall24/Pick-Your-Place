# HelloPlus Project

This directory contains the **HelloPlus** program, which demonstrates the use of basic form handling using Bootstrap and JavaScript. The program collects user input from a web form, processes it with JavaScript by storing the data in an object, and prepares it for further use.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `helloplus/netid` directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the form.
4. Fill out the form and observe how the JavaScript handles the input.

## Application in Group Project:

This technology can be applied to collect user data efficiently within our group project, such as for user registration or information submission. The combination of Bootstrap for responsive design and JavaScript for data handling allows us to build dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.
