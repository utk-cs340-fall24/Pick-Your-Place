# Exploring the Implementation of a Button-Triggered, Dynamic Offcanvas Component from Bootstrap
---
## Practice working with the following relevant languages/frameworks: Bootstrap, html/css

Two major components of our project includes two dynamic navigation bars- one is meant to 
display the details of a city and the other showcases the list of destinations the user 
has appended to their bucket list. Through this assignment, I am exploring the possible
html/css implementation of the basic structure of the latter of these two navigation 
bars through bootstrap's offcanvas component. Here, I programmed a button that will 
trigger the navbar to appear from the left-hand side of the screen (and gave the button
a custom image). The screen behind the navbar will dim, and the navbar can be hidden 
again after clicking an 'X' at the top right of the bar.`Ideally, achieving a basic 
framework of this navbar through the helloplus assignment will enable a smooth transition 
for the implementation of a functional list display feature into this component by 
the end of the first sprint.
