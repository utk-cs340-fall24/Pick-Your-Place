# Sprint 2
- Sanya Shrivastava
- sanya-shrivastava
- Pick-Your-Place

## What you planned to do
- Issue 29: planned to populate all city offcanvases with example information
 (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/29)
- Issue 30: planned to implement checkbox functionality, essentially adding the city,country to the bucket list when the checkbox is clicked on (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/30)
- Issue 31: planned to organize the country bucket list by countries (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Pick-Your-Place/issues/31)

## What you did not do
- I was suppose to populate all the city canvases. I did do that, but it seems there might have been some problems with the us file because the implementation of any of my issues is not working with the us file. However, the exact same implementation is working with all the other cities, so we plan to try and fix the us file soon.

## What problems you encountered
- Had a hard time getting started with javascript since I had never used it before
- It took a while to conceptually understand how to implement my issues

## What you accomplished
Throughout this sprint, I was able to populate the city offcanvases with sample text from the data.js file. Later on, we will be updating the sample text with actual information. I was also able to add the checkbox functionality. So, I was able to add a city,country to the bucket list if the user clicks on its respective checkbox. Also, I was able to make sure that the country bucket list was organized by country.
