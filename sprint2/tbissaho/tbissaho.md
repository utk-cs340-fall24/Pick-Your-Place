## What you accomplished

For this sprint I was able to add alerts for when the user adds or removes a city, attraction, food place, and lodging. It disappears after three seconds and has a colored animation based on if it was added or removed. I add the search bar functionality to all the country pages that way you can search for a specific city for that country.
